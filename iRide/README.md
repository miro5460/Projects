##### 1. All aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented. One CSS file names notuber_style.css is used to give Google Maps appropriate styling. My location is retrieved using JavaScript navigator.geolocation object. My location is sent to the ride request API using XMLHTTPRequest w/ "POST". My location is displayed on the generated map with a smiley face icon, clicking on my marker displays my username and the distance in miles to the nearest vehicle or passenger. The position of vehicles/passengers occurs depending on the info being served by the ride request API. Clicking on these other icons displays the username of the selected user and how many miles they are away from my marker. Passengers are marked using a thumbs-up icon, and vehicles are marked with specified car icon. 
##### 2. I worked alone on this assignment. The following sources were used as references:
